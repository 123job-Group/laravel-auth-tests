# laravel-auth-tests

These are some boilerplate PHPUnit tests that will provide coverage for Laravel's auth scaffold. Drop them into a fresh (or existing) Laravel app that uses the scaffold to ensure your users can register, login and reset their passwords.

You may need to adjust them if you've customised your app's auth flow at all, but that's probably a good thing.
